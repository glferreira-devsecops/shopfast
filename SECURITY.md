## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ShopFast team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**
   - Navigate to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form

2. **Email** (if GitHub Security is not available)
   - Contact information available on GitHub profile
   - Use subject line: `[SECURITY] ShopFast - Brief Description`

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Varies based on severity

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` for templates
   - Keep sensitive data out of version control

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Review security advisories
   - Run `npm audit` before releases

3. **Code Review**
   - Review all security-related changes carefully
   - Test authentication and authorization flows
   - Validate input sanitization

### For Deployment

1. **Supabase Security**
   - Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
   - Use appropriate RLS policies
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use environment variables for secrets

2. **Frontend Security**
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Authentication**
   - Use Supabase Auth for user management
   - Implement proper session handling
   - Enable email verification
   - Use strong password policies

## Known Security Considerations

### Database Access

- All database operations use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Products and categories are read-only for users
- Admin operations require elevated privileges

### API Keys

- Supabase anon key is safe to expose in frontend
- RLS policies protect data even with exposed key
- Service role key should NEVER be exposed

### Session Management

- Sessions are managed by Supabase Auth
- Automatic token refresh implemented
- Sessions persist across page reloads
- Sign out clears all session data

## Security Measures Implemented

### Application Level

- ✅ Input validation on all forms
- ✅ XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- ✅ CSRF protection via Supabase Auth
- ✅ SQL injection prevention via Supabase client
- ✅ Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Database Level

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Foreign key constraints
- ✅ Data validation at database level
- ✅ Audit triggers for critical operations

### Infrastructure Level

- ✅ HTTPS enforced in production
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Automated security updates

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Determine the severity
3. Develop and test a fix
4. Release a security update
5. Credit the reporter (if desired)

### Public Disclosure

- Critical vulnerabilities: Disclosed after fix is released
- Medium/Low vulnerabilities: Disclosed in next release notes
- Reporter credit given unless anonymity requested

## Security Update Process

1. **Patch Development**
   - Develop fix in private repository
   - Test thoroughly
   - Prepare security advisory

2. **Release**
   - Deploy fix to production
   - Publish security advisory
   - Update version number
   - Notify users if necessary

3. **Post-Release**
   - Monitor for related issues
   - Update documentation
   - Review security measures

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices including:

- OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- CWE/SANS Top 25 considerations
- Secure coding standards
- Regular security audits
